# Deep Learning for Thyroid Ultrasound

This repo will be updated with source code and models for our RSNA 2018 abstract, "Predicting Thyroid Nodule Malignancy Using Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks." Stay tuned ...

Ongoing work: 
  1) External validation 
  2) Automatic TI-RADS
  3) AI vs. Radiologist // AI + Radiologist
